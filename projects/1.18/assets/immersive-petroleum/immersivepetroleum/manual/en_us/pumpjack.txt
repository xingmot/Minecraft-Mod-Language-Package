Pumpjack
Pump, pump it up
<&pumpjack0>
The Pumpjack is a multiblock that pumps liquids from deposits situated underneath bedrock once they have been tapped by the <link;immersivepetroleum:derrick;§o§nDerrick§r>. <np>
The structure is formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block on the second layer.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.

The Pumpjack Tower uses <config;i;pumpjack_consumption> Flux/t to pump liquid at a rate of <config;i;pumpjack_speed> mB/t. Liquids are output through the two side ports with orange dots.<np>
Pumpjack head pipes (the well-block at the very tip) must be placed above a pre-drilled well that is exhausted of pressure from the <link;immersivepetroleum:derrick;§o§nDerrick§r>, and cannot pump straight from the ground.

The average Oil deposit will take <config;i;pumpjack_days> days to deplete, though adding more Pumpjacks can speed the process. Some reservoirs, once the reservoir's hydrostatic pressure is below equilibrium, will replenish fluid that can be extracted by the Pumpjack.
