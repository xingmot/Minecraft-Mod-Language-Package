Lubrication
Slip and slide
Machines have many moving parts, where gears grind past each other or bearings spin on their mounts. While gearboxes can operate without <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oLubricant§r;lubricant>, lubrication allows machines to operate faster.

Not all machines benefit from lubrication, however. Only machines with high mechanical load do, such as the <link;immersivepetroleum:pumpjack;§n§oPumpjack§r>, <link;excavator;§n§oExcavator§r>, and <link;crusher;§n§oCrusher§r>.

Lubrication will allow machines to operate at <config;d;autolubricant_speedup>x speed.<np>
<link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oPetroleum-Derived Lubricant§r;lubricant> is the most effective lubricant, but <link;squeezer;§n§oPlant Oil§r> can also be used to lubricate machines, at the cost of consuming much more lubricant.

Iron Golems may also be lubricated, healing them and temporarily increasing their speed and strength.

Both Iron Golems and machines will drip spent lubricant while in use, a handy sign of if the machine is lubricated.
<&lubricant1>The Lubricant Can can be used to manually apply a lubricant to machines. Once the can is full, simply use on a valid block to lubricate it.

A <link;chemthrower;§o§nChemical §o§nThrower§r> can also be used to apply a lubricant to blocks, albeit less efficiently. Simply spray lubricant onto a machine to apply.

Manually lubricating machines can be tiring and often frustrating. Once attached to a machine, the Automatic Lubricator will lubricate the machine as long as it is provided with lubricant.

The point where it must be attached is highlighted while holding a lubricator in your hand, and when correctly placed, lubricating pipes will form around the machine.
